# Introduction

Thank you so much for taking your time to contribute to the Juka project.
We are in need of the help, and we appreciate any help we can get.


## Contributing
Create a new branch, work on it, and create a pull request once you are done working on the feature.


## Found a bug?
Bug fixes are always welcomed and are encouraged. 
You can post them as issues tab on https://github.com/jukaLang


## Styling
Juka is built on top of .NET. Please follow the coding outlined at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions


## Documentation
Anybody is free to fix the documentation. The Documentation is one of the harder part of the project. It's hard to write it, and it's even harder to maintain. If you can help with that,
it will be greatly appreciated. 

## Testing
Most of the testing will be automated. However, there is no substitute for a human being. The testing is harder than coding. Writing a test for Juka is always welcomed. 
Make sure to focus on edge cases when you write a test.

## Submitting to GitHub
Keep the code clean by following K.I.S.S. principle. If you want to make a major change, just fork the project, update it, and once you've fully implemented the fix, submit a pull request to the main project.
