# Writing your first application

## Hello World
Let's start by creating a HelloWorld application.
Create an empty file and save it as HelloWorld.juk

In that file, copy and paste the following code:

```jsx
func main() =  {
   printLine("foo");
}
```

Once done, save the file and run an appropriate command to compile the file
