# Строки


## Определение строк

You can define string by using quotation: **"**

For example,

```jsx
"cat"
```
will be a string, while

```jsx
cat
```
is an object


## Combining strings with a number

Whenever you add string to a number (or vice versa), the end result will be string. The numbers are implicitly converted into strings.
